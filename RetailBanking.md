# Retail Banking

Retail banking, also known as consumer banking or personal banking, is the most common form of banking. It focuses on providing financial services to individual customers and small businesses, rather than to large corporations or other financial institutions (which is the domain of commercial or corporate banking).

The core of retail banking is to facilitate the day-to-day financial needs of the general public.

Key Products and Services
Retail banks offer a wide array of products and services designed to help individuals manage their money, save for the future, and access credit. These include:

Deposit Accounts:

Savings Accounts: For holding and growing funds over time, often with interest.

Checking Accounts: For daily transactions and managing expenses.

Fixed Deposits/Certificates of Deposit (CDs): For saving a lump sum for a fixed period at a higher interest rate.

Credit and Lending:

Personal Loans: Unsecured loans for various personal needs.

Home Loans (Mortgages): Loans for purchasing a home.

Auto Loans: Loans for buying a vehicle.

Credit Cards: A revolving line of credit for purchases.

Payment Services:

Debit and Credit Cards: For making purchases and withdrawals.

Online and Mobile Banking: For managing accounts, paying bills, and transferring funds remotely.

Digital Wallets and P2P Payments: Services that enable seamless digital transactions.

Other Services:

Wealth Management: Providing investment products like mutual funds, insurance, and retirement plans.

Forex Services: Currency exchange.

Safe Deposit Boxes: For storing valuable documents and items.

How It Differs from Commercial Banking
The primary distinction between retail and commercial banking is the clientele they serve and the scope of their services.

Clients	Individuals, families, and small businesses	Businesses, corporations, and government entities
Products	Standardized, mass-market products (e.g., mortgages, personal loans, credit cards)	Highly customized and specialized services (e.g., trade financing, cash management, large business loans)

Focus on Customer Advocacy: Moving beyond transactional relationships to build trust and loyalty by providing valuable financial guidance and empowering customers.
